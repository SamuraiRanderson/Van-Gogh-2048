#Van-Vogh-2048

This is a custom version of Gabriele Cirulli's [original 2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) to tinker with. You can play the the game [here](http://samurairanderson.github.io/Van-Gogh-2048), or try out Gabriele's version, but be careful... it's addictive.

##### Donations
Gabriele made this in his spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`.
